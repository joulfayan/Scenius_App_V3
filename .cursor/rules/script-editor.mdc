# Script Editor Requirements
- Provide screenplay formatting with keyboard shortcuts.
- Show **live duration** (per scene and total) as the user types.
- Support **version history** (v1, v2, …) with a simple diff view.
- Embed **element tagging**: text selection → tag dialog → writes to Catalog.
- Expose computed scene timings to Stripboard and Gantt.
