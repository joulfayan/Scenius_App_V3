# Navigation
- Implement a left sidebar with phases: Write, Breakdown, Visualize, Plan, Shoot.
- Add a top bar for quick actions (Import, Export, Run Breakdown, Generate Call Sheet).
- Persist active phase via URL query (e.g., `?phase=breakdown`) to support deep linking.

# Patterns
- Use card/grid layouts for Storyboard and Mood Board with drag & drop.
- Use inline-editable tables for Catalog, Contacts, and Scheduling lists.
- Respect color coding for element categories.
- Keyboard-first affordances in editors (script shortcuts, tagging hotkeys).

# Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Support keyboard navigation.
- Mobile-friendly for on-set use (call sheets, contacts, locations).
