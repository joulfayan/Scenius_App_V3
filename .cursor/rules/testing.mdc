# Tests-First Workflow
- For new modules/components: write unit tests (and simple integration tests) **first**.
- Each PR: include minimal test coverage and a short file header doc.
- Add lightweight logging for async flows (fetch, sync, export).
- After implementing, propose follow-up tasks if gaps are found.
