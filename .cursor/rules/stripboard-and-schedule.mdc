# Stripboard MVP
- Drag/drop scenes into days; standard strip color conventions.
- Show day total duration; warn if over target day length.
- Respect filters (INT/EXT, DAY/NIGHT, location).

# Gantt/Calendar
- Visualize scheduled scenes/days with labels and simple dependencies.
- Sync with Stripboard data (single source of truth).
