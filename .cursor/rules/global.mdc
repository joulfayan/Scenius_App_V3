# Scenius — Global Principles
- Workflow-first: Phase-based navigation (Write → Breakdown → Visualize → Plan → Shoot).
- Keep UI **dense** for data (catalog/schedule) and **spacious** for creative (storyboard/moodboard).
- Auto-sync changes across modules (Script ⇄ Breakdown ⇄ Catalog ⇄ Stripboard ⇄ Call Sheet).
- Zero manual duplication: updates in one module ripple through others.
- Print/export quality is a feature (PDF/CSV).
- Budget is a first-class citizen across modules (cost awareness in planning).

# Deliverable Quality
- Prefer small PR-sized changes.
- Add minimal inline docs and tests with each feature.
- Avoid breaking existing code; if you must refactor, stage it with tests.
