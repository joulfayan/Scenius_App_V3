- Use Firebase Web v9 modular SDK (import from "firebase/*").
- All project data lives under projects/{projectId}/...
- Always write timestamps with serverTimestamp().
- Link records using arrayUnion/arrayRemove for IDs.
- Real-time UI uses onSnapshot() subscriptions.
- Collections are created on first write; no pre-provisioning.
